Flash Card Quiz Project

Our project, the Smart Flashcards & Quiz Platform, is a web-based application designed to help students create, study, and quiz themselves using digital flashcards. Users can create their own sets of flashcards, organize them into categories, and choose between study modes such as reviewing cards, taking quizzes, or using random shuffle mode. The platform focuses on simplicity and usability, making it a lightweight but powerful study tool.

Users will be able to register, create personalized decks, and add their own flashcards with terms and definitions. They can study their cards in different modes, including flashcard review, multiple-choice quizzes, and self-testing. A progress tracker will show users how many cards theyâ€™ve mastered and where they need improvement. The platform will also feature a search function for organizing cards and saving decks for future use.

We will be using Java with JavaFX and CSS for the main code and Google Firebase for the database.
